(1) `assets/gallery/resize_image.sh`: this script is used to auto resize original image into different sizes. This assists in gallery generation.
To use the script, classification images into landscape (width >= height) and portrait (width < height) type is required.

Run:
```bash
./resize_img.sh landscape PATH/TO/FILE/OF/LANDSCAPE/IMAGE/LIST
./resize_img.sh portrait PATH/TO/FILE/OF/PORTRAIT/IMAGE/LIST
```
