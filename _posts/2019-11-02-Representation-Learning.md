### PCA
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimension reduction method and is mostly used in exploratory data analysis (EDA) and for making predictive models.
I like the concept of PCA for the sake of visualization. For multivariate dataset, say more than 3 dimensions, it is impossible to visualize these multiple dimensions.

This video from [StatQuest](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtYLUTtgS3k1Fg4y5tAhLbw) gives a immensely good explanation of PCA. I genuinely enjoy the way Josh Starmer, owner of StatQuest, simplifying everything in his lectures by explicit examples for problems.
