After implementing GradCAM with ResNet50 pre-trained on ImageNet for [Dogs vs Cats](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats) data on Kaggle, I found something funny things about cats. (just for fun)

See more details of my implementation in this Kaggle Notebook: [link](https://www.kaggle.com/nguyenhoa/dog-cat-classifier-resnet50v2-tf-keras-gradcam?scriptVersionId=35394264) 

>What I did:
>* Took ResNet50 model trained on ImageNet, made prediction with dog and cat images and observed GradCAM
>* Did transfer learning with ResNet50 on dogs & cats data by taking out its top layer on ImageNet and add my own output layer with two nodes for classification of dogs & cats.
>* Observe GradCAM with the trained model on dogs and cats data. The last convolution layers were still generated by RestNet50 weights on ImageNet.

Cats always think that they have a super power to rule the world until one day they meet `ResNet50` guy who doesn't know who cats are.

***Ok, I'm fine if you are 95% sure that I'm a Koala***

***But wait, what? Among 1000 classes, you still think I am most probably a dog? Feeling underestimated!***

***How dare you ignore me in the corner and just look at that boring bucket???***

***It's too much! I can't stand it. I am lying here like a God and you dissolve me in the doormat.***

But at the end of the day, hoooman broke cats' heart when finally ResNet50 recognized one cat sticker but hooman labelled it as a dog.
